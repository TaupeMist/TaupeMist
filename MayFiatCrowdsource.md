# May Fiat Crowdsource

__I would like to formally announce that fiat currency will be officially added to the Taupemist asset portfolio!__

On April 16th, I opened a euro fiat account with a German direct bank called N26. This account will be controlled by and belong to the Taupemist organisation. It will allow Taupemist to diversify its portfolio and allow for the addition of many future services/products incl. Power Up (margin borrowing) and a Gateway (fiat to crypto exchange).

To celebrate this announcement and provide an initial fiat position, Taupemist will hold a crowdsourcing event for the entire month of May. 

### How does it work?
On June 1st, 5TM will be distributed to the crowdsource participants where each participant will receive a percentage of the total 5TM equal to the percentage of their donation within the total donation amount.

__Example Scenario 1:__
1. John donates $500
2. Jane donates $500
3. Crowdsource end
4. John receives 2.5TM and Jane receives 2.5TM

__Example Scenario 2:__
1. John donates $500
2. Jane donates $500
3. Jim donates $1000
4. Crowdsource end
5. John receives 1.25TM, Jane receives 1.25TM, and Jim receives 2.5TM

### How can I participate?
Send your donation to Taupemist's bank account:
IBAN: DE47 1001 1001 2628 2501 49
BIC: NTSBDEB1XXX
Account Holder: Cole Morton

### When can I participate?
At any time between 12:00 a.m. 01/05/2018 and 12:00 p.m 31/05/2018.

### How often can I donate?
You can donate as often and as much as you wish within the month of May.

### What if I don't have an EU bank account?
N26 bank has partnered with an excellent payment service called: [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/). Transferwise supports currency transfer from various origins incl. Australia and Brazil with extremely low fees and is the recommended method for sending non-euro currency to the Taupemist account.

### If I don't participate in this crowdsourcing, will I have the ability to purchase TM using fiat in the future?
Members with an Expert membership will have access to the Gateway service which will be released at a future date.
The Gateway service will enable members to exchange fiat for cryptocurrency (including TM) and vice versa.
