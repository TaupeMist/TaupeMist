# THE TAUPEMIST ORGANISATION

## Introduction

The transparent, immutable and trust-less attributes of blockchain technology provide an ideal testbed for a myriad of future technologies, specifically distributed, censorship-resistant, autonomous, open-source organisations.

In an environment where all actions and communications, whether of data or value are autonomously recorded transparently, 100% accountability behind each action can be asserted.

When unfavourable actions pose a direct risk to that actor's reputation or economic opportunity, actors are naturally incentivised to participate positively and this forms the foundation for a RaaR (reputation as a resource) model. 

## What is Taupemist?

Taupemist is a non-profit cooperative organisation, and a digital identity created to participate as a positive actor in current and emerging decentralised economies.

Taupemist resides completely and entirely within a RaaR protocol, currently consisting of the Steem and Bitshares high-performance blockchain platforms.

The Taupemist digital asset (TM) will be used to denote the level of memmbership with the organisation, to compensate contributors, and to incentivise participation.

Taupemist is scalable, flat, transparent and dynamic, and represents the requisition of the value lost in traditional centralised, hierarchical organisations.

Our mission is to support and facilitate the integration and education of blockchain technology into society and this will be achieved through a plethora of community-driven services, products and projects.
