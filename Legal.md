# The Taupemist Organisation and TM asset legal document

### General information
In order to participate in the Taupemist ecosystem, an asset will be available to the potential members, in exchange for cryptocurrencies and fiat currency.
The Taupemist Asset known as TM is a token, which will allow the member to access the services provided by the Taupemist organisation.
The Taupemist organisation may distribute this TM to members in the form of an exchange, however, no profit will be derived from this exchange.
TM does not have the legal qualification of a security since it does not give any rights to dividends or interests.

The TM asset cannot have a performance or a particular value outside of the Taupemist organisation.
The TM asset shall therefore not be used or acquired for speculative or investment purposes. The TM asset will not be listed on any regulated stock exchange. The TM asset will not be or nor has been filed with regard to legal standards such as the Federal Act on Stock Exchanges and Securities Trading law, the Financial Market Infrastructure Act, the Collective Investment Schemes Act, which are not applicable to the distribution or exchange of the TM asset, therefore laws and acts that ensure that investors are sold investments that include all the proper disclosures and are subject to regulatory scrutiny for the investors' protection, are not applicable in this case.
Any acquirer of the TM asset should receive proper advice in order to understand whether the asset is appropriate for him or not.
Anyone acquiring the TM asset expressly acknowledges and represents that she/he has carefully reviewed this white paper and fully understands the risks, costs and benefits associated with the TM asset.
