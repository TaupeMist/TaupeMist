### 2018-01-16 - Setup and misc

All of my trading and investment actions related to Bitshares, Binance, and Bittrex alongside the operation of the TaupeMist
CryptoCompare profile are actions made at my discretion depending on the amount of time and resources I have available to
dedicate towards it.

TaupeMist does not introduce any additional overhead or requirements in regards to my trading activities,
therefore I will not charge the shareholders any fee for participation. All bounties so far have been organised by myself and
their rewards were paid by my personal account.

All participants of TaupeMist should be fairly compensated for their
contributions, therefore I believe that 5TM @ $50 (being the initial asset price) would fairly compensate myself for the
following expenses:

- Setup and credit of the taupemist1 account.
- Creation of the TaupeMist asset. Price ~220USD.
- Organisation and execution of share distribution #1.
- Organisation and execution of share repurchase #1.
- Creation of TaupeMist ChainBB forum.
- TaupeMist ChainBB forum moderation and operation.
- Creation of new Taupemist GitHub user.
- Creation of TaupeMist specification 0.1 on Github.
- Creation of Telegram group.

The up-front setup and creation costs were paid from my personal account in exchange for a retainer (3TM).
I plan to receive the remaining compensation (2TM) on Friday the 19th of January as share repurchase #1 concludes.
I will use this amount similarly to the first period, as capital towards bounty rewards and payment for
contributions to TaupeMist.

**All future transfers from the taupemist1 account will be disclosed publicly inside the TaupeMist community in advance.**
