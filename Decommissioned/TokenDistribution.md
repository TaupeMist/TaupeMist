# DECOMMISSIONED

# Token Distribution v1.0

Access to TM (the Taupemist asset) is currently invite-only to ensure manageability, security and organic growth. Therefore, permission is granted on an individual basis.

Your level of access to Taupemist's services, products and bounties depend on the amount of TM in your possession.
This will replace the existing service charge or subscription fee model found in typical *aaS services.

All users need to be white-listed before they're granted the ability to own, buy/sell TM on the Taupemist:bitUSD market, and to send TM to other white-listed users.

### How can I become white-listed?
1. Recieve a verbal or written invitation from me (Cole) to join.
2. Register your accounts within the Account Directory.
3. Within 24 hours I will white-list the user to allow access to TM. 

### What are the requirements for participation in this distribution?
The member must currently possess or will possess sufficient TM after their next distribution purchase to comply with the Taupemist Membership Access.

### How can I purchase TM from the distribution?
1. Contact me personally to inquire into the availability of TM.
2. If TM is available it can be sold immediately to members.

**If you have any questions or uncertainties, then please ask via a reply to this post.**
