# Bounty Reward: Aspiring Merchant

### Objective:
To promote and incentivise member participation in share repurchase #1.

### Reason:
The first objective of the Taupemist asset was a distribution, which has since been successfully achieved.
The second action will be the opposite of the distribution, which is a repurchase.
A distribution followed by a repurchase demonstrates the M.V.P (minimum viable product) which is an end-to-end complete circulation of value between the members and taupemist1.
The higher the participation volume in the distribution and repurchase, the greater the evidence to support its success (or failure).

### Criteria:
Simply participate in the share repurchase.

### Reward:
Each member who participates in the share repurchase will receive a **25% cashback refund** on their first Taupemist sell request.
1 Taupemist ($110 at the time of writing) will be allocated towards this bounty and will be provided by my personal account (cole-morton) as a donation to the Taupemist community.

### Closing Date:
This bounty will remain active until the entire 1 Taupemist has been awarded or until 12:00 p.m Thursday the 18th of January.
