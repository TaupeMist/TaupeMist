### The name of the first bounty is: What is TaupeMist?

This is a classic game of hotter/colder where TaupeMist users can investigate and discover the meaning of TaupeMist
and what it is in an entertaining and educational way while receiving TaupeMist rewards.
This bounty is only available to the current shareholders of TaupeMist however, any shareholder can and is encouraged to
outsource to and/or seek assistance from external sources.
Any questions that have already been asked inside this thread, or are answered clearly or explicitly inside this forum or
the specification at the time the question was asked, will be *excluded* from any rewards.
All rewards will be displayed in USD and paid in the equivalent value of TaupeMist at the time the question was posted.

### This is how it works! Take a look at the draft specification: https://github.com/TaupeMist/TaupeMist
Create question(s) regarding TaupeMist that you believe are truthful.
Simply, post your question(s) inside the "What is TaupeMist?" thread.

Here are all available rewards:

1. The first hot question will receive a first strike reward of 5$.
2. Each user will receive a participation reward of 5$ for their first hot question.
3. Each hot question will be rewarded with 2$.
4. The hottest question at the end of the period will receive $10.

### What are hot and cold questions? A user asks "Is TaupeMist an organisation?". 
If the answer to this question is yes (or at least more yes than no)
then this question would be considered hot and would fulfil reward #3.
If the user then asked "Is TaupeMist a slice of pizza?", then the answer to this question would be no which
would be considered cold and would receive no reward. Any question that is more truthful than false is considered hot.

### When does this bounty close? $100 of TaupeMist will be used to back this bounty.
This bounty will officially close when the sum of all rewards reaches $100.
