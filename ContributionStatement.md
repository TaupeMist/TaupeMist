# Contribution Statement
**A statement that contains one or more contributions, details what they are and illustrates the value that they will provide to the Taupemist organisation.**

### What is a contribution statement?
Taupemist members have the ability to create a statement for any and all content, resources or actions i.e contributions that serve to either directly or indirectly increase the long-term value of the Taupemist organisation.

Once the contribution statement has been created, using the Sentiment service, that member can submit a compensation survey to determine the amount of TM to be paid by the Taupemist organisation to that member as compensation.
__The compensation amount should be based on the value that those contributions are projected to add to the organisation in consideration of the total amount of TM currently in possession by the organisation.__
On completion of the contributions within the statement, that member is eligible to claim their compensation which will be paid to the amount determined in the compensation survey.

This provides members with a clear, deterministic revenue stream and the opportunity to monetise content regardless of whether it was created specifically for Taupemist or not. The member will always retain full rights, ownership and accountability for their contributions.

A statement can be created before, during or after the commencement of any work required for the contribution, however, the earliest point possible is preferred as expectations can most easily be adjusted.
