# Resource Exclusivity v1.0.0
**Taupemist members can reserve exclusive access to resources.**

### What is Resource Exclusivity?
The resources and assets that belong to Taupemist are limited.
This poses an interesting question in an environment where members have equal rights to use or access those resources.
How can limited resources be distributed fairly and equally amongst members?
The Taupemist organisation does not and will not impose any fees or prices on its members, therefore no price will be established by Taupemist.
In the scenario where one or more members that have equal rights invoke the use of a scarce asset or resource, an exclusivity mechanism will be utilised in order to fairly resolve any conflicts.

### How does it work?
Taupemist has two main resources available for exclusive use by members, these are bitUSD and USD.
They each represent crypto and fiat respectively, and at any point of time will have equal or similar values.
Many services and features of Taupemist use or require bitUSD and/or USD, and members must ensure that that when using
these services/features, that they currently have sufficient exclusivity for the required resources.

Each resource will be accompanied by two pools.
The **first pool**, known as the **Resource Pool**. This will contain the resource itself.
The **second pool**, known as the **Staking Pool**, will contain TMA.
Members seeking exclusivity of resources, will do so through the staking of TMA into a position within the staking pool.

##### A member's staking position respresents a percentage proportion of the shared staking pool.

##### The composition of the staking pool serves as exclusivity in the resource pool.

##### The staking pool is a mechanism that provides fluid and automatic price discovery.

##### When a member uses exclusive resources, they release a proportionate amount of TMA in the staking pool to Taupemist.

##### Members may increase their staking position for greater exclusivity, and conversly, decrease in order to withdraw their TMA.

**Example Scenario:**
1. Resource Pool: $1000 BitUSD
2. John stakes $20 of TMA
3. Jane stakes $20 of TMA
4. Staking Pool: 50% John; 50% Jane
5. John activates the Taupemist Gateway service and wishes to convert BitUSD to USD.
6. According to the staking pool, John currently has access to the Resource Pool for a maximum amount of 500 BitUSD.
7. John sends $400 USD to the Gateway.
8. $16 of John's TMA stake position is released to Taupemist.
9. John recieves $400 BitUSD.
10. The discovered price margin is calculated as follows: 100 / ($400 / $16) = 4%
