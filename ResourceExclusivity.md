# Resource Exclusivity v1.0.0
**Taupemist members can reserve exclusive access to resources.**

### What is Resource Exclusivity?
The resources and assets that belong to Taupemist are limited.
This poses an interesting question in an environment where members have equal rights to use or access those resources.
How can limited resources be distributed fairly and equally amongst members?
The Taupemist organisation does not and will not impose any fees or prices on its members, therefore no price will be established by Taupemist.
In the scenario where one or more members that have equal rights invoke the use of a scarce asset or resource, an exclusivity mechanism will be utilised in order to fairly resolve any conflicts.

### How does it work?
Taupemist has two main resources available for exclusive use by members, these are bitUSD and USD.
They each represent crypto and fiat respectively, and at any point of time will equal the same or similar values.
Each resource will be accompanied by two pools.
The first pool, known as the resource pool, will contain the resource itself.
The second pool, known as the staking pool, which will contain TMA.
