# Gateway v1

### What is a gateway?
This is a fiat to crypto gateway and in this initial release, will facilitate the exchange of fiat to bitUSD and vice versa.
The fiat and bitUSD to be used in this service are contained within Taupemist's investment portfolio as are all assets belonging to the Taupemist organisation. It is essential that the current investment objectives are maintained and this service does not operate in detriment to the organisation and it is for that reason, that the availability of fiat and bitUSD within this gateway will fluctuate over time.
The amount of fiat and bitUSD available will be advertised and logged historically through the comment thread of this Steem article.
As Taupemist is a non-profit organisation, members are not required to pay any fee or profit margin.
The exchange will occur at a 1:1 conversion ratio.
Due to the limited availability, the gateway service will be offered on a  first-come-first-served basis. 

### How does it work?
Taupemist members that hold the required level of membership and desire to exchange bitUSD for fiat or vice versa should first check for the availability of their desired asset in the comment thread.
If their desired asset is available, then they can make a gateway exchange request.
The request will receive a response within 24 hours, which will be an approval if the desired asset is indeed available.
On approval, the member should transfer their asset to Taupemist and when received, Taupemist will transfer their desired asset to the member.
