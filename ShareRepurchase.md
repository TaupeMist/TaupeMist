# Share Repurchase #1 18/01/2018 12:00 p.m

I hereby announce that the first share repurchase is now open!

### What is a share repurchase?

A share repurchase is a process of returning the value of the investment portfolio directly to shareholders who seek realise their profit or cash out by allowing shareholders to sell a portion of their TaupeMist asset back to the taupemist1 account. 

### How does it work?

The process can be executed in various ways, however, this share repurchase will be executed in the following manner:

1: Any shareholders who wish to sell their TaupeMist asset will send the desired amount, to the taupemist1 account.

2: At 12:00 pm on Thursday the 18th of January, a snapshot of the investment portfolio's one month chart will be taken (in USD). The average value will be divided by one hundred to determine the monthly average value of each TaupeMist.
This will be referred to as the TaupeMist M.A.P (monthly average price).

3: The total amount of capital to be returned to the shareholders will be equal to the total amount of TaupeMist received multiplied by the TaupeMist M.A.P.
This capital will be known as the repurchase pool and will consist of bitUSD only.

4: Depending on the amount of bitUSD currently available, some investment positions may be closed to ensure that sufficient bitUSD exists within the repurchase pool.

5: Once the repurchase pool contains sufficient bitUSD to cover all TaupeMist sell requests, I will then buy each TaupeMist at the TaupeMist M.A.P.

### Terms and Conditions:

Any shareholder who wishes to participate must send the TaupeMist that they wish to sell to the taupemist1 account before 12:00 pm Thursday the 18th of January.
Any TaupeMist received after that time will be excluded from the share repurchase.
